# Chlo√© de Lune
 A project that showcases my ability to make a web application from scratch. In this application I have a static webpage that loads a screen for my poetry. My poems are randomized each time a user refreshes the page. The user can post a comment. The comments are stored in a database and the comment is posted and the page is updated in real time. The webpage also plays the Clare de Lune by Debussy in slow motion. 

 I really just wanted to make a room on the internet that was my own and that also allowed users to interact with the space.

 This application uses MATERIAL UI, SQLite, Python, HTML, and CSS.
